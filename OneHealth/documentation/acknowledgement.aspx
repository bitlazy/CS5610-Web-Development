			CS5610 Web Development : This course has re-defined my way of learning. The strategy of learning by doing experiments has made me not just understand but, master the areas of the subject I experimented. I would like to take this as an opportunity to thank <strong>Prof. Rasala</strong> for providing such freedom to experiment and learn such a sophisticated course work.</p>
		<p>
			I also thank my TA <strong>Yitao Xiong</strong> for his time and patience in analyzing my work progress each week and for his constructive feedback which helped me greatly in learning the flaws in my understandings and thereby, correct it. I also took a cue from Yiato&#39;s homepage and project on designing elegant web pages with simple color shades.</p>
		<p>
			Finally I thank the customer support team of the PillBox API who responded to my call immediately and brought back the API service online which was down initially.</p>
